## Building in Visual Studio Code

First, clone this repo using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/NeoGenio/Canary.git` to clone all submodules as well.

Install the C/C++, CMake Tools and GNU Assembler Language Support (for syntax highlighting) extensions.

Then open the project in vscode. If you installed the CMake Tools extension, then the project should be automatically configured. Which means you don't have to run 'cmake' manually. Press Fn+F5 to build and debug. If you want to run the project without debugging then press Shift+Ctrl+B (Shift+Cmd+B on Mac) and select 'Run' from the menu.
